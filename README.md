# Sentiment_Analysis_using_NB
Sentiment Analysis is an important field in Natural Language Processing. This project is an example of how to do Sentiment Analysis.
This project contains Data Preprocessing techniques (Data Cleaning, Vectorizations) etc. and proper training and testing of data. 

The data which is used here is downloaded from Kaggle which is IMDB Dataset. IMDB is a site that contains different movies and this dataset 
has reviews against movies. This dataset has 50000 reviews and labels againt reviews if the sentiment is positive or negative. 
You can download the dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

Moreover, The Machine learning model that I have used is Guassian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Burnaulli Naive Bayes. It is a good 
approach and it produces awesome results when working with categorical data.
